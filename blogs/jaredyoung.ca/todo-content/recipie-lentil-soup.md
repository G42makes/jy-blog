As part of out cost saving measures around here, I decided to make some
Lentil Soup that we could freeze and have any time this week. In the
past we have been influenced by a recipe we saw on [Good
Eats](http://www.foodnetwork.com/good-eats/index.html), so I decided to
use the printout of that to guide me. Luckily this recipe is rather
tolerant of messing up in almost any way, so I happily get most of the
measurements wrong. It still tasted great when done.

This recipe is a slightly modified version of the one found on the [Food
Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/) for [Lentil
Soup](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lentil-soup-recipe/index.html),
and they deserve credit, if you want the original recipe, go there.

Lentil Soup
===========

Ingredients
-----------

*All measurements are approximate, feel free to be a little off in your
favor.*

-   4 tablespoons olive oil
-   2 finely chopped onions
-   3 finely chopped carrots(about 1 cup)
-   2 finely chopped stalks of celery(about 1 cup)
-   3 teaspoons kosher salt(table salt is fine, use less)
-   1kg lentils(about 2lb), rinsed and cleaned
-   Â 28oz can of Diced tomatoes(14oz of tomatoes would be good too,
    anything chunky)
-   1 qt of veggie broth(I live with a vegetarian), chicken broth
    probably works fine too
-   coriander
-   cumin

Directions
----------

You will need a [dutch oven](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_oven) or
a large pot to cook this in. Chop your carrots, celery and then onion. I
use a generic version of the [slap
chop](https://www.slapchop.com/ "Warning, auto playing Vince video!") to
do this, it easy and the texture is not a big thing in the final soup.
Put the veggies in a bowl ready to be cooked. Place the pot on medium
heat, or just a bit above and add the olive oil. Try to ensure you coat
the bottom, and not much more. Give it a few minutes to heat and then
add the veggies you chopped plus the salt. The guys on the food network
will call this a sweat, but really just let it cook for about 6 minutes
and you should be good.

While waiting on the veggies to sweat, rinse the lentils repeatedly
until the water runs clear. Drain them and get them ready to go in the
main pot. Once the sweat is done(I can use technical terms too!), we
will add the rest. In this order add the lentils, tomatoes(straight from
the can is fine here), broth, about 1/2 teaspoon each of coriander and
cumin. Stir it all up, the lentils will probably have stuck together in
a couple of big clumps. Crank the heat to high and leave the lid off.
Keep an eye on this, stir it a few times(not a lot) and when it looks to
be boiling, turn the heat to low and put the lid on. Go find your
kitchen timer and set it to 35 minutes and go read some
[websites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentil)(don't forget to bring
the timer!).

Now that 35 minutes have passed, you've learned something new and your
soup is almost ready. Hopefully you have an immersion or stick blender
handy. Run it in a few short pulses right in the pot and see if you like
the consistency. Run it more for a thinner soup and stop when happy. You
now have soup. If you don't have an immersion blender, just take some of
the soup and use a real blender or food processor to beat it up a little
and mix it back in. Repeat until happy and then go buy an [imersion
blender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_blender).

Consume Food
------------

Nothing really needed here, make some toast or add some parmesan or
cheddar cheese on top. It freezes great and can be eaten any time.
Enjoy!
