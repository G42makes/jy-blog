Goals Completed Today: 5 targeted resumes sent out(some really good
options this time), sick dog dealt with some more - doing better,
cooking up some bulk meals - lentil soup via [Alton
Brown](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/lentil-soup-recipe/index.html),
and watched Harry Potter finale. I'm exhausted and still have to finish
the final step of the soup.
