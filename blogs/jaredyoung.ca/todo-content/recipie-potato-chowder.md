While I now have a job again, I have not yet received my first full
paycheck. Because of this we still need to be a bit tight with our
money, and make sure out meals last a while. I decided to replace the
stash of quickly disappearing [Lentil Soup](http://jaredyoung.net/?p=79)
with another old favorite of mine: Potato Chowder. This recipe is
relatively simple, tastes great and uses cheap veggies for the primary
ingredients. This soup is a bit more picky about the measurements, try
to get them much closer to right as if you make a mistake it never
really thickens into a good chowder.

The recipe was first found at [AllRecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/)
for [Potato Chowder Soup
I](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/potato-chowder-soup-i/detail.aspx).
There are some minor changes, mostly that I make a double batch of 16
portions(their portion calculator can help you with this).

Potato Chowder
==============

Ingredients
-----------

*All measurements are approximate, except the follow must be as exact as
you can do: butter, milk, flour*

-   4 cups peeled and diced potatoes(around 1/4 - 1/2 inch cubes)
-   1 cup diced carrots
-   1 cup diced celery
-   1/2 cup chopped onion
-   2 teaspoons salt
-   1/2 cup butter
-   4 cups milk(2% is what I have used)
-   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
-   60 ounces ( 4 x 15 ounce or 5 x 12 ounce cans) whole kernel corn,
    drained
-   5 cups of shredded Cheddar cheese(I use pre-shredded to save time)

Directions
----------

I have found that the technique of [Mise en
Place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place)(measure and prepare
ingredients into bowls) that all the TV chefs use is useful for
preparing this dish. Chop your potatoes, carrots, celery and onion.
Measure the portions of these and put them aside. Measure out portions
of the butter, milk and flour. Drain the corn and measure out the
cheese. Now that we can just thrown in the ingredients, we can start.
Grab a big pot(I used the second largest I had, this makes a lot of
soup) and put the potatoes, carrots, celery and salt in it. Give it a
shake to make sure it's all level and settled. Fill the pot with tap
water until all the veggies are barely covered(if some stick out a
little, no problem). Put this on to boil, and once it's boiling try to
bring it to a simmer(just barely boiling, a few bubbles coming through)
and keep it there for about 20 minutes. (I used a timer, but the next
step takes about this long anyway.)

While the veggies are simmering, we will make a
[Roux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roux). This can be a bit hard, but
take your time and you should be OK. Grab a pot and put the milk and
butter(I used a stick of it, you can measure how you like) in. Put the
heat to medium low(half way between low and medium) and wait until the
butter starts to melt(little pools of butter will float on the milk,
they don't like to mix). When the butter starts to melt, very slowly
start adding the flour and mixing. Do not stop mixing until the flour is
fully mixed in and the roux starts to get thick. When the butter is
fully melted you can add the flour a little bit faster. You may get
lumps, try to break them up as soon as you see them, we want this
smooth. If all goes well you will have a nice thick, great smelling
mixture in your pot just as the 20 minute timer ends for the veggies.

Now, pour the roux into the veggies(no draining them) and add the corn
and cheese into the mix. Stir this beast until the cheese has melted.
Put the veggie pot on the lowest heat setting until you serve the food.

This soup needs nothing else added, but you can do some toast or garlic
bread to help clean the bowl. Freeze unused portions and it will last a
long time, microwave to reheat and enjoy!
