While my partner and I both want to own kayaks, we are not in a
financial position to make that a reality at this time. Therefore we
will take opportunities to borrow or rent them when it suits us. This
past long weekend we had decided to go
[Kayaking](http://www.capitaleducanada.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16297-16299-10170-49685-49889-49893&lang=1)
in [Gatineau Park](http://gatineaupark.ca/) at least one day, and we
headed up Monday morning to Lac la Pêche to rent a kayak and take a loop
or two around the lake.

On our way up I took the 148 past Luskville and turned into the park to
get to the lake access. Unfortunately, due to the heavy rains this year,
part of the highway is washed out and we had to take the detour on the
back roads to get around it. Luckily for us the detour ended across the
road from the route we wanted to take. We took the winding, rolling road
through the north part of Gatineau Park and headed into the lake access.
La Pêche is a part of the park that you have to pay to access, it's fun
because there is this small section of paved road with a toll booth in
the middle of a long back road with loose gravel. Ten dollars gets you
into the park, and you can go swimming or use the lake for free if you
have the equipment. We parked at the first parking lot and headed down
the hill to the boat rental shack. Don't head to the beach if you want a
boat, stop at the first option or you will be walking a lot.

The tandem kayaks are not the ones you would buy, they work fine, but
are designed for durability, not usability. We paid another \$36 for 3
hours(rounded up a bit), which was plenty of time for our level of
fitness paddling kayaks. We hopped in, put our valuables in dry bags or
pelican cases(we've done this stuff before) and headed off for the far
side. I did not bring a camera with me this time, so we just went to
enjoy the lake. Last time we had been here we were with a group and
explored the deeper southern part of the lake, so this time we headed
west and stayed in the very shallow northern parts. With the kayak we
had, there was almost no draft so we could go in water less than a foot
deep no problem. We were stirring up silt and swamp gasses all over the
place, but we didn't mind. The lily pads were blooming, yellow and
white, so we played in them for a while and headed to a point in the
lake for a drink and snack. This point used to have a cabin on it, but
currently is a great spot to stop for a while with some shade and easy
boat parking.

We headed off from the point, due east to try to find a shady paddling
area, but were unsuccessful, so we played around a bay for a bit and
decided to head back. The westward portion was the hardest, the winds
had picked up and we were headed right into them. We were forced to
paddle non stop for about a kilometer lest we get pushed back and loose
ground by the wind. We rounded the point, fought with the kayak to go
back to the rental shack and landed after a nice trip out. Exhausted and
happy.

If you don't know how to kayak, or canoe, it might be worth it to learn.
Once you know the basics, and they really are basics, you can find
places like La Pêche or Lac Philippe to [rent
equipment](http://www.capitaleducanada.gc.ca/bins/ncc_web_content_page.asp?cid=16297-16299-10170-49685-49889-49893&lang=1)
at any time you want. Less investment and you don't feel bad for having
yet more sports equipment that you are not using.

All in all, a good way to spend a sunny holiday Monday.
