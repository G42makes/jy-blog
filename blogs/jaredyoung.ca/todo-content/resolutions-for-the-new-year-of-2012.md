I'm already late and behind schedule with my resolutions, but here they
are(subject to additions, probably no subtractions):

<ul>
<li>
Publish to this and one other blog at least once a week.

</li>
-   I'm already behind on this, but I hope to catch up.

<li>
Run the half-marathon at [Ottawa Race
Weekend](http://www.runottawa.ca/).

</li>
-   I want to really improve on my time from 3 years ago, based on my
    marathon time at the 1/2 way point I think training past my target
    distance is doable and should be my goal

<li>
Other Exercise

</li>
-   [Climbing](http://www.coyoterockgym.ca/) weekly
-   [Crossfit](http://www.crossfitottawa.ca/)

<li>
Loose weight, reasonably.

</li>
-   Excercise more: see above
-   Eat
    Better: possibly [paleo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet),
    but I don't know yet
-   Keep [walking to
    work](http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/uMz5z_pI7gc), start running
    or cycling some extra distance home

<li>
Process approx 1000 photos per week

</li>
-   I have over 70,000 photos to process, I need to organize and process
    them properly. I'm already behind on this one too.
-   Blog about what I was up to when they were taken an post a gallery
    of the ones I like

<li>
I have one or two private ones, just for me to know, but they should be
noted in case I decide to follow up on this post and say how things are
going.

</li>
<li>
I'm sure there are more and as I said, I will add them if I come up with
them.

</li>
<li>
(<span style="color: #ffff00;">EDIT</span>)Carry my camera with me more,
keep one in my work pack.

</li>
<li>
(<span style="color: #ffff00;">EDIT</span>)1 certification of any form
per month average, 12 for the year.

</li>
-   Cisco, Microsoft, Linux, other

</ul>
So, the plan is this: Schedule my evenings to include taking care of
these tasks. Leave the weekends free for catching up and doing longer
runs.(Plus skiing in the winter). The current plan looks like the
following:

-   Monday - Running
-   Tuesday - Climbing
-   Wednesday - Photos/Blog
-   Thursday - Running/Skiing
-   Friday - Unknown/TBD

<!-- -->

-   Saturday - Running/Skiing
-   Sunday - Rest/Skiing

Does this mean I should be going for a run tonight? The weather is
crappy, but I have the gear for it. I think I should, especially since I
cheated and brought the car to work.

Diet changes must be taken on carefully. I am sensitive to some
preservatives(and I don't know which so I avoid most). Katherine, being
vegetarian, will need some special planning done if we want to do a diet
like paleo. There are other options, so we will check this out.

Beyond all that, I want to solidify my place in my new office, make sure
I have room to grow and take advantage of those oporitunities when they
present themselves. I know that sounds like marketing speech, but really
I don't have a different way of saying that I just want to do well over
the next year.

Well, it's off to an OK start, I have a new blog post up, right?
