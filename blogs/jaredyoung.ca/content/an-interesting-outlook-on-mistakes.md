In this video by [Vsauce](http://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce) he
discusses mistakes, and it's worth a watch(as are many of his videos).
But, there is one part, which I have linked to below, that I found
interestingly profound.

In it he discusses an outlook on your past mistakes that I really like.
How they stay the same size, no matter how much you grow, but your
growth makes them seem smaller.

I like to live my life with very few regrets, I have a couple, but I
don't worry about every missed opportunity. If you tend to worry about
past mistakes a bit, maybe consider his advice.

And watch the whole video, it's nice.
