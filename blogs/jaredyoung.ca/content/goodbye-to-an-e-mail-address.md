I recently received the following message in my general mailbox:

  > As a way to help you transition away from

Now, how do I retire an email address? Let's see...<!--more-->

Let's start at the beginning. I was issued a BlackBerry device by my
employer about 6 years ago, and I proceeded to get it setup for myself.
At some point I created a BlackBerry email address to forward important
messages to my device even if other services were down(ie, mail server
is down, therefore I probably should not email myself at that address).
Over the years, with different accounts and devices I was able to
maintain this account. I didn't share it much, as it worked best as an
account for important messages, but I did use it for Facebook due to the
integration with the app provided on the device.

A year ago I bought a BlackBerry 10 device, the Z10, and it didn't
support any integration with that email address. I was required to
forward to another mailbox, which I did. And now they are shutting it
down.

I now need to go find all those services that I have associated with
this address, and change their settings. This is a minor inconvenience
for me, but I know that when I was doing outsourced IT, I setup many
users to have their own BlackBerry email address. These people are not
technical, and I hope that they are able to keep these email addresses
as long as they have a device, because it will be a real pain for them
to change it.

Now, off to search my perpetual inbox for things I have to update...

-   Facebook
-   BlackBerry ID
-   BluesFest

That wasn't too bad, I hope I didn't miss anything.
