The empty corner of my garage. Hanging bracket on the left is the end of
a storage area, on the right is the door rail and it's support
beam.

I have more projects that I want to complete, and building a climbing
wall in the corner of the garage is one of them. To get things started I
took the template from my Ski Press CAD work and modified it to
represent the space I will be using. Because the climbing wall will need
to have more support on the structure of the garage, I added in the
studs and beams that I could locate to the template and put in a few
more things I needed to keep in mind when designing the walls(like the
garage door rail and the ceiling storage frames).

This was pretty basic, and I suspect there were easier ways to get this
done in the CAD software. I just modified the length of the walls and
components to match the space I was using. The roof slope is the same,
so no changes there. I added in the storage support beams first, based
on measurements, and then added the beams behind the wall, one by one. I
was glad to see the beams and storage supports lined up, it meant that
my measurements were not bad at all. I did add some 50% transparency to
the walls and ceiling so that I could see the supports behind them
properly. This seems to expose a bug in the rendering software that is
kinda annoying. It appears that, as I rotate the scene, the transparent
walls move in relation to objects close to them. You may see some odd
rending errors related to that, and I might not keep them transparent
for all renders.

I did get to start learning about doing extrusions in the CAD software.
For some reason I felt like modeling the garage rail accurately. I could
easily and reasonably just done a bounding box for it, but instead I
measured the shape of it, drew it and did an extrusion of it. It looks
nice, and accurate, so I'm keeping it. The biggest problem for me was
rotation of the finished product. Originally I created the extrusion and
then copied it to my garage project, but it was rotated wrong, and for
the life of me I could not get the rotation settings to work in such a
way that I could put it in it's proper place. I went back to the
original file and rotated the profile sketch properly before the
extrusion. This allowed me to import a properly oriented rail and move
it into place easily.

Template is well laid out, and the next article will have my initial
wall layout setup on it.
