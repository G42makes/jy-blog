Designing the climbing surfaces of my climbing wall is a major step to
getting it built. With the space of the garage corner accuratly
modeleted, I can easily try out multiple designs and decide which one I
liked. Based on some reasearch online, I was planning to have a section
of vertical wall, some mildly sloped and the rest at a more extreem
slope, with some technical corners wherever I could fit them. I was able
to achieve all my goals quickly with the design outline I ended up with
in this phase of the design.

A basic layout showing the climbing surfaces without some of the filler
angles and panels yet added.

The design I went for was 2 panels at 30 degrees angle, and 2 panels at
15 degrees around the corner. It creates an interesting shape that I
want to use. I keep the rest of the panels vertical so that I can access
the storage beside it. A little creating box building on the ceiling and
I can avoid the beam and rail for the garage door.

Once feature I had read about, and integrated into this design, was
storage behind the wall. There is a lot of space there, and it will be
built to hold the weight of a person. What we do is leave a spot open to
get in behind the wall and maybe put up some shelves. Additionally, the
box at the top of the wall will be able to hold plywood sized objects
with no great problem(just a little acquired to get things up there).

Next step is to plan out the support beams for this, and how they
integrate into the existing structure. I also need to decide if I will
be using 1/2 inch plywood of 3/4 inch, and if I will use 2x6 or 2x4
beams to support the structure(or a mix). Once that is done I will be
able to come up with a full cost breakdown of this project, and maybe
some stages that I can do the work in so that I can pay as I go.
