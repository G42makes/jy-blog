Alright, I decided to accept the new job offer that I received. So I
headed into the office for early this morning and filled in the
paperwork. This of course means that I'm officially employed again and
could start working, so I did. Since I'm working in the normal, for me,
outsourced IT field, I needed to learn the policies and procedures that
allow this office to get work done. I shadowed one guy for about half a
day, the rest of the day I explored the systems, clients, monitoring and
ticketing systems to get a feel for how things work. I have so much to
learn on this front.  
<!--more-->  
Getting used to 9 hour work days will be fun, but 1 hour lunches are
something I can use if I like, heck I could go home, eat and get back to
work in that time. I know I won't, but I could. I'm looking forward to
being able to start solving problems, as that will get me going on
understanding and using our systems to a way better level. There is
still much to see. Of course any of the non-technical stuff is stressing
me out, but it should be no problem to get over that once I've been
there a few weeks.

We shall see. This does mean that I will not be creating my own business
at this time, so I think that category is defunct. Too bad, I would have
learned a lot doing that, I just don't have the time or freedom in my
contract to really pull that off.
