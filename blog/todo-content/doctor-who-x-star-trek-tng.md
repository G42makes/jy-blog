It looks like this might now be a joke, but a real possibility exists
that a Doctor Who crossover with Star Trek: The Next Generation will be
completed in comic book form.<!--more-->  
According to [this
post](http://www.themarysue.com/idw-star-trek-doctor-who-crossover/),
the crossover is official, and no release date is set. I look forward to
seeing what this turns out as, but for now just the teaser images.
