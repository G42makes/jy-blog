Back into my runs, after some weeks of either feeling sick, or not
feeling like running on soft snow(which really messes with my feet). I
reset my distance goal, and was aiming for 6KM on the run, but arch pain
in my right foot made me decide to call it a day. Turned out to be
exactly 3KM back to home, so no problem there. I will try to get 4KM on
Wednesday.

I decided to explore some of the local roads near my hour, intending to
cross over Martin Street and explore some of the random ones there as
well. I only really got a tour of the dead end streets in my area before
I called it quits. If they ever add housing to this area of town, I
don't know that they will have a lot of options on where to add the
connections.

First run in a while, other than my arch pain I was feeling a bit at a
loss for breath, nothing too bad, but I was watching my breathing most
of the way. I've found that a tree step count for each of breathing in
and out is best for me to avoid getting abdominal pain, and I often just
concentrate on that when I start thinking about my breathing or start
feeling pain.

My heart rate monitor is still convinced that I am working at the top of
my ability, but it also says my resting heart rate is in the 100bpm
range. I think I need to replace that, but I will be waiting on a
monitoring device that I ordered recently to see if that helps. If not,
I'll see about getting a new monitor, or if I can calibrate this one.
