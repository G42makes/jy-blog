So, I have been working on a business plan related to starting an IT
company. It's one of my options in case I don't find a good job soon
enough for my comfort. It also keeps me busy after I complete my job
search for the day, as setting up a blog and going through my photo post
processing backlog are really not enough for me.

As I consider all the ideas that I need to include, and review what I
need to put into this document, I have hunted around for ideas.
Additionally, while reviewing my news feeds in [Google
Reader](http://www.google.ca/reader/) I decided to see what items it was
recommending. Wouldn't you know it, just the type of article I needed at
this point(the beginning of the process) pops up in my
[feed](http://www.technibble.com/so-you-want-to-start-your-own-it-business/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=so-you-want-to-start-your-own-it-business).

So much more work to do, and if I don't find a good job in the near
future, I will be using this to try and create a job. I'll document more
here as I go, and if I move in another direction I may decide to post
what I have to let another try working with it.
