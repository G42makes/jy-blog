While visiting a friends place for nachos I noticed a recipe for nacho
soup on the bag. I didn't take a copy of that recipe with me, but I did
start digging around for a recipe. My friend Nic let me know that he had
been sent a recipe he liked by his fiance and forwarded me a copy. This
is one of those recipes with lots of room for experimentation and
changes. The version I received did not include any peppers in it,
probably due to the source not liking them, but I was able to add them
in with no problems.

Below is the recipe as I actually cooked it, but I do want to try making
my own seasoning next time. Please note that this recipe can take 6-8
hours to cook, but it's worth it.

Taco Soup
=========

Ingredients
-----------

*All measurements are approximate, feel free to use more or less as you
feel comfortable, the amounts below tasted great to me.*

-   1 large yellow onion, chopped
-   1 red/yellow/orange/green pepper, chopped
-   1tbs olive oil
-   Ground black pepper
-   Ground white pepper
-   Lemon pepper seasoning
-   Crushed red pepper flakes
-   2 cups water
-   2 packages of veggie chicken ground, 340g each(you can use 1.5lb of
    ground anything)
-   1 package of taco seasoning
-   2 bay leaves
-   1 28oz can crushed tomatoes
-   1 28oz can diced tomatoes
-   2 12oz cans kernel corn, un-drained
-   3 19oz cans of beans(your choice, mix em up, pinto, black eyed,
    black beans), un-drained
-   Juice of 2 limes, fresh squeezed

Directions
----------

Heat the olive oil in a very large pot or frying pan(if you are using a
frying pan you will have to transfer to a pot later, I just found this
easier). Saute the onions, peppers, black pepper, white pepper, lemon
pepper and crushed red pepper flakes in the frying pan until the onions
start to brown.

Add in the water(yes all of it) bay leaves, ground meat and taco
seasoning. Cook until the meat is cooked and broken up, this took a bit
of time as I used frozen veggie chicken and it needed to defrost in the
pan. If using a frying pan, transfer the contents to a large soup pot.

Put the pot on low heat, maybe 1 or 2 on your dial, and add all the
remaining ingredients. Just cut the limes and squeeze them by hand if
you can, discard the remains. Leave on low heat to simmer for 6-8 hours.
Watch for too much bubbling or none at all, you want to keep it minimal.
There will be a skin forming once in a while on the surface, just use
that as a chance to stir the whole pot and it will dissolve.

Make sure you stir a few times over the day.

Serving
-------

Makes about 12-16 servings.  
We ate it with just some shredded cheddar on top and nacho chips as
spoons. Additional suggestions include garnishing with tomatoes, fresh
onions and a dollop of sour cream.  
This recipe freezes well, and is great for a quick lunch with some
leftover chips.
