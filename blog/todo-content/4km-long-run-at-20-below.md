The cold has returned to my part of the world, after a week or two of
warmer temperatures. -20 C plus some wind, and I had ice hanging off my
eyelashes.<!--more-->\[iframe

I knew tonight's run was going to be cold, it was saying about -18 C
when I checked the weather report before my run, and thatÂ  was a stale
temp even then. After I got back I found it was closer to -20 C. That's
cold for running, doable, but cold.

Packed on all the cold running gear, and added a thin pair of long
underwear that fit like tights for some extra warmth in my legs. There
is not much I can do to keep my feet and ankles warm, but I was able to
pull the long underwear down a bit to cover my ankles.

Once I hit the road, it was two laps around downtown and a short back
and forth near my house to add a few meters. My feet were freezing, and
starting to get painful within 1/2 KM, but most of my feet were warmed
up shortly after that. My toes took almost another 1KM to get warmed up,
and I had started wondering if I was going to have to stop somewhere
warm to take care of them. But, once they warmed up, it was great, very
comfortable and toasty, on pavement, concrete ice or snow. I could feel
that stopping or even slowing down would be a bad idea though.

My pace was significantly slower, at 6:15 / KM. But I'm O.K. with that
for a longer run, in such cold and with the sidewalks barely cleared. I
was not too sore, not too winded and basically felt great after the run.
Seems like that was a good idea. I'll save the speed for shorter runs.

I really need to document my stretches, so I can be sure I do them
right, and all of them, but even with what I remember, it really helps
with the soreness. I wish I had thought of this earlier.
