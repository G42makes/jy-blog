Just a short 6KM run to get us back into the feel of running. after each
KM we did a short 30 second sprint followed by a walk if needed. I'm
happy with the time, but would like to get it down while getting the
distance up. Next time we will aim for over 7KM and 45 second sprints on
the KM. The route was just a set of roads and paths in the experimental
farm, and an extra 500m out and back up the recreation path across
Merivale. One upside was that I was able to multi-task this run by
having my BlackBerry headset in. I decided to use them because the new
Endomondo update supports giving you some stats updates when you press
the embedded button on the headset, and that option works great. I
received a phone call while on the run in relation to one of the resumes
that I had sent out today and setup an interview for tomorrow. That is
multi-tasking: get in a run and book a job interview.
