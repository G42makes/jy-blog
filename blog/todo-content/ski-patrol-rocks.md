What did you for fun this weekend? Did you stay inside and watch some
TV, maybe hide under a blanket and surf the net? If you, like me, live
somewhere where winter is a cold and snowy, there is a real possibility
that you are not getting enough sunlight if you stay hidden all weekend.
Working a 9 to 5 job means you are often at the office during the whole
sunny part of the weekday.<!--more-->

A solution that many people use is to go out and do something.
Unsuprisingly for some people that does not work every time. I often
just feel that momentum is working against me and staying home is just
easier. Because of this I need to create some obligations releated to
getting outside. In my case that is the CSPS, Ski Patrol. I've been a
member in multiple capacities since 2005, and due to the roster
commitment I know that I will get outside at least one weekend out of
3(usually more).

So what do we do? Glad you asked. Mostly we ski. Yeah, we get to go ski.
We do try to ski as much of the hill as possible, and keep an eye out
for safety issues, but if it's a slow day, we do a lot of skiing. Check
out one of my tracks on
[Endomondo](http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/jAljUW5Ce_0) and even
after removing the uphil and some erratics from bad GPS signal, I still
ski over 20KM on a slow day( I've done over 40, probably closer to 60
some days). Beyond skiing we do first aid. In the initial training you
spend many hours getting a full first aid training. This includes health
care provider level CPR, AED(defibrilator) and general injury training.
Since this is a usefull life skill to have, you are already ahead by
that point.

Once you get to your hill you are not done, we now need to train you to
do first aid on a ski hill. An unfortunate fact of life is that people
do not get injured in convenient places. If everyone were to get injured
at the bottom of the hill next to the ski patrol shack we would be good,
but that is not going to happen. With this in mind the ski patrol kindly
provides training in handling toboggans that can be used to bring a
patient down the hill in a nice controlled, yet reasonably fast, manner.
You will be a better skier after doing this training, but you don't have
to be amazing to start it. Once that is done, we like to make sure you
can do everything as one package, so we do one final test.

In our final test we simulate an injury, usually a bad one, somewhere
remote and out of the way(ie hard to get into/out of). You are the first
to arrive, in charge of the scene and can request other patrollers to
assist you. This leads into my weekend. You see, I was helping with some
of the training. The final test we ran on the final rookie for this year
needed to be done before the end of the month, and the rookie was strong
in most areas so we decided to make it a harder one. This led to a
simulated patient on the hardest run on the hill(a glade run through a
boulder field and trees, known as The Gauntlet). The patient needed to
be put on a backboard, and was under an overhanging boulder. I was
selected to run the toboggan(OK, I volunteered, it's fun) into the site
as I had the most knowledge of the run, and so I went and had a blast
getting there. We completed the backboard properly, loaded the simulated
patient and decided our plan to get down the hill. Since I was still the
familiar one, I decided to walk it down the trail to the shack, an easy
400M through bush, bumps and trees. This leads to the following picture,
taken just before we started out.

Yeah, while exhausting it was a good day. We pulled him out, finished
the test and were done with another batch of rookies for this year.

Some other pictures from that timeframe:

Join the Patrol, We Can Use New People(Pakenham will happily take most
people, if you can make it down the hill, we can make you into a
patroller).

There are few things better than standing on the top of the ski hill on
a crisp winter morning, only a few other patrollers around you. The hill
is perfectly groomed and not a mark on it, the sun is just hitting the
top of the hill. Your job is to ski down this hill, taking your
time(yeah we check for problems, but that is fine with me). Often you
get the whole run to yourself. Knowing this, I wish I knew how to say
this in Klingon(paraphrased): "Today is a good day to ~~die~~ ski."
