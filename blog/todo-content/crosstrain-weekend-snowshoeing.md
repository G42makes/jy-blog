Alright, since I don't have a lot of free time or energy on most
weekends, I still need to get some exercise in to ensure I can keep
increasing my stamina. This weekend it was a snowshoeing trip down the
Mississippi River.<!--more-->\[iframe

A cold day, with some fresh snow on the ground from the day before. We
parked near the start of the trail and headed out. Others had been on
the trail recently, but not since the latest snowfall, so we were doing
a minimal trail break while out there. We never saw anyone the entire
time we were out.

The route that people were taking at the start was not the route of the
trail as I had hiked it in the summer, so I headed off the beaten path
for a bit. It was fun to go near the top of the ridge and plow through
some of the deep snow drifts that were up there.

Can't say much about the rest of the go, it was out and back, we enjoyed
the weather and the view and didn't see much of interest. Overall, a
good time.
