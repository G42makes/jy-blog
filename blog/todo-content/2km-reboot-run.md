About 20 weeks to [Ottawa Race
Weekend](http://www.runottawa.ca/ "Run Ottawa"), and I need to get
myself up to speed on running in my new shoes: [Vibram Five
Fingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/products/Five-Fingers-BikilaLS-Mens.htm "Bikila LS").Â 2KM
to start and we will see where it goes from here.<!--more-->

Short run for me, I need to reset my speed and my running style now that
I run alone. 5:40 average pace per KM works for me for now, but I want
to work on getting that lower. Probably on the shorter runs each week if
I run them.

Since it was about -13C out there, it took me about 1KM to get my feet
to a comfortable temperature in these very thin shoes, but after that
they were great. The ice from the past few weeks of insane weather made
it impossible to maintain proper form for the entire run, but I was able
to keep it close and not walk for the entire run.

Samsung Rugby was a bit slow on getting the GPS fix once outside, but it
looks to have recorded the run fine. Didn't play any music, so it was a
quiet run.

Overall: Good Run, if short.
