Since I'm resetting my pace and my running style, I'm not going to
increase my distance too fast at first. 3KM felt better at the end of
the run then 2KM did last week, so I think my muscles agree with
me.<!--more-->

One of the problems I experience at the end of a run is muscle soreness,
mostly in my calves. My plan to address this is to build up a post run
stretching routine. In the past I have never done this, but with the
soreness lasting a day or two and making walking fun for much of that, I
think it is time to take action.

I did some basic stretches designed  for post run use last night, but
mostly to see how they felt. They were about 1 hour after running, so
less useful. Additionally I did use a foam roller on my calves, and that
helped as well. Next run I will try to do all of this before my post run
shower, when the muscles are still all warmed up.

Upcoming challenge: long runs in a small town.
