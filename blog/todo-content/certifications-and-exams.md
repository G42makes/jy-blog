I happen to have a reasonably large skillset, not just with IT, and
since it is mostly self taught I often have to find ways to prove that I
actually have the skills that I claim. In the past that has generally
seen me aquiring Microsoft certifications. I am currently MCSE(Server
2003 w/ Messaging) and MCITP(Server 2008 Enterprise Admin). My current
job has less of a requirement for me to maintain those certifications,
so I will be looking into other ones, but I will not be giving up on
Microsoft technologies.<!--more-->

Looking forward I see a need to get Cisco and Linux certifications. I
work with a limited set of Cisco hardware at the office and some
teaching opporitunities coming up would prefer that I am Cisco
certified. Therefore I will work to complete the Cisco certs first.
After that I would like to get the LPI certifications on either
Debian(prefered) or Redhat(still often needed).

Lucky for me there is a testing center downstairs, so I don't have to
take much time off work to do any writing of exams that are available
there.

Looking at 12 exams of the next 12 months, here are my ideas as they
stand now:

<ul>
<li>
LPI - 8 Exams to Reach Full [Level 3
Enterprise](http://lpi.org/linux-certifications/programs/lpic-3) Cert

</li>
-   CompTIA Linux+ is actually LPI Level 1

<li>
Cisco -
[CCENT](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le45/learning_certification_level_home.html)
and then
[CCNA](http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/le3/le2/le0/le9/learning_certification_type_home.html)

</li>
<li>
Microsoft - Exchange 2010 and Lync Server

</li>
<li>
Microsoft -
[MCT](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/certification/mct.aspx):
MS Certified Trainer

</li>
-   Needs CompTIA
    [CTT+](http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/ctt.aspx)

<li>
CSPS On Hill Instructor(need to re-qualify for this)

</li>
</ul>
Now, I'm sure there are other things to do, and this will cost me some
money, but I believe that it's a good goal to have and it will keep me
on my toes technology wise. I currently have a Cisco and Server lab
setup with a Technet subscription to allow me to setup and test things,
and I am working on getting one of my Cisco routers to be used as my
primary router at home. Hopefully I can use the other router as my
primary test box, and I will see what I can do with the other equipment.
