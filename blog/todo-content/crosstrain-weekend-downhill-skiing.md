I had been watching the weather as the weekend approached. We were
expecting 10 - 15 cm of fresh snow Saturday and the weather delivered.
Luckily it was my turn to ski all weekend.<!--more-->\[iframe

After the last two rosters, I was expecting something to go wrong and
make this weekend into a real tough workout, but that never
materialized. We had no major incidents, the snow came down when we
expected it and the skiing was great.

I spent a chunk of Saturday showing one of the new(to the hill, not to
the job) people the glade runs, as they were approaching perfection.
Once the snow started it was just too much fun to play on the fresh
powder and work on my carving.

Sunday the powder slowed us down a bit, ensured that the falls were
cushioned and pulled in the crowds. There were cars parked all the way
up the road, all the lifts were running and no one was getting too badly
hurt. I'll take that any weekend.

About 30 KM per day of skiing, count about 3/5 of that as time on skis,
the rest on the lift. With the time in the glade runs I really worked on
my leg muscles, and the time on the main runs was great for working on
rotation of my upper body.

Overall, no complaints about that weekend of skiing.
