After the arch and knee pain of last week, I was worried that this weeks
6KM run would be difficult, if not impossible, to complete. As it turns
out, it was the perfect distance for me to be doing right
now.<!--more-->\[iframe

If you take a look at my map on Endomondo, I had some problems with my
GPS, and may have run a bit further then I think, it's hard to tell.
Additionally, I decided to head as far out of town as I could in a given
direction(while still having sidewalks to run on in general).

The sidewalks were clear, but there were light flurries falling, and
near the end of the run their accumulation effected the landing of my
feet and started to mess with my arches again. Other then the last 1/2
KM, I was really enjoying this run and was able to maintain a good pace
the whole way. Big fluffy snowflakes are nice to run in, and look
amazing in the right light at night, but sometimes they land in your
eyes and mess up your vision completely. Luckily the temperature, around
-12C, was great for running.

Near the end I was getting stitches in my abdomen, and the afore
mentioned arch pain, but with only a little bit left to run, I decided
to just push on through. I changed my breathing pattern and was able to
deal with the stitches, and made sure I ran on exposed pavement where
possible to help my foot. Looking at the GPS, I may have already been
done when this started, so that works for me.

Felt great afterwards, no tight muscles, even the next day. I wonder
what it was that helped: skiing, yoga, stretching after runs or
something else? Unfortunately, while Endomondo recorded this as a number
of personal best times, I have to discount them as they include the
chaotic bit at the beginning of the run.
