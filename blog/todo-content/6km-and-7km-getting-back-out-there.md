With the crazy winter weather this year, and a late spring, my running
has taken a beating, but now that the snow is gone and the weather is
looking up, I need to get out there and get my distance up. Last two
runs were interesting, either raining or windy. I've been doing out and
back runs towards Blakeny, and it's been a good route with plenty of
space and few cars, so I'm probably sticking with it for a
bit.<!--more-->

Two runs, the 6KM one was a good run, rather wet with the rain, but
otherwise great. My new running jacket was able to keep me dry in my
core and that meant I could concentrate on just the run.

The 7KM run was done before I finish recovering from the last one, I
need to get in my distance and this run was a real mental push to keep
myself going. Stitches started early and never really went away, even
with good breathing. Legs started sore and stayed that way, and around
5KM I was unable to maintain the proper stride for my style and fell
back on heel strikes. I really had to push myself to keep under 45
minutes for the run, and upped the pace at the end to get my average
down.

I'm not looking forward to the next run, aiming for 8KM, but I think I
can do it. Yoga this evening will help with the sore muscles, the
running has already helped with my sore back some.
