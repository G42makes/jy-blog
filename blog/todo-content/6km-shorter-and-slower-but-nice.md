It is the first time in a while that I have run in the sun. I decided to
head out right when I got home, with the sun still up, and clear skies,
it was a good time for a run. I was still sore, just a little, in my
legs from the last run, so I decided to go for 6KM today and cut it
short if I found I was hurting too much. Turns out I was not hurting too
much and was able to complete a slower paced run around a bit of the
town. It won't be long now before I start doing a full lap of the town
on my longer runs.

I decided to not push my pace today, and appear to have completely
ignored that during the first kilometer, but after stopping at the
lights on Ottawa St, I slowed down to a easier pace. This was good for
me to finish the run at, with some variations. The only problem I found
with the slower pace was that I was unable to get my breathing right at
the beginning and had to work on it later on to deal with stitches.

Finished the run with no real extra pain in my legs, and little muscle
soreness, so I think that was a success. I really don't feel the need to
push myself so hard that it is a chore to go run, I see no reason to run
hurt and make it worse right now, and if it's still hurting days later,
I figure it's good to let the body heal before pushing it again. I do
push myself sometimes when out for a run, but that is usually because
I've invested the time in getting out, so I might as well try to stay
out.

Hopefully Monday is a good day to run, I want to get in 10+ KM. I'll be
doing laps of this town soon enough.
