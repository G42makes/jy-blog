At the advice of a friend, after I had expressed my concerns about long
runs with my expensive phone, I purchased a second hand Samsung Rugby
(GT-S5690R - The Rogers version.) phone for my runs. This device is able
to take a beating, but it runs older hardware and needs some tweaking to
get it right.<!--more-->

The day I bought this was also the day that Katherine broke the screen
on her phone. So I gave it to her for the first couple of weeks. It
survived that test, so it's a good sign. Since then I have installed
Endomondo on the phone, set it up for myself and done a few runs with
it. The GPS is slow to lock, and I don't know how accurate, but it works
for my running. I have not been using music on it yet, but that changes
with tonight's run. The biggest problem I have had is that there is
almost no space to install apps(as not all can go on the SD card) due to
the junk that was pre-installed and the updates that want to be
installed.

So, time to learn to root my first Android device. Some quick googling
and I was looking at using SuperOneClick to root it. The files for this
app include an exploit for Android devices, so I had to disable my
anti-virus first. Ran the app and attempted root - failed. Retry and
just get the same thing: "Operation not permitted". I guess that is not
going to work.

A bit more digging brought me to this [XDA Dev's
thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1651781), and
the attached file. Loaded that file onto my SD card directly and
rebooted the phone as instructed. Once in there I was able to easily run
the installer provided, reboot and found that I had root access to my
phone. Excellent.

I tried a few apps to allow removal of system and pre-installed apps,
some just would not work, but I settled on [Root App
Delete](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zsj.android.uninstall&hl=en).
A few minutes later and I had some free space, removed apps that wanted
insane updates and was ready to go.

I really need to see if I can get away with removing the dialer from
this device, as I don't have phone service on this SIM card, it should
be doable... That's one for another day.
