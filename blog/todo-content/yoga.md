There are plenty of people in the world who will tell you that yoga is
great and you should be doing it. Believe me, I know about twenty of
them. I never really thought they were wrong, I just never saw an
opportunity that worked for me to try it out. I decided to change that.

To start I did some research. Jeff loves his yoga teacher at the college
fitness center, but the timing on those classes was really bad for me.
Right now I have a lot of free time on Tuesday nights due to Katherine's
league practices, so I dug around for somewhere that would have classes
for beginners around the same time. My research led me to the [Rama
Yoga](http://www.ottawayoga.com) in the core. Not far from the gym where
I needed to pick Katherine up, and a beginner class on Tuesday evenings.
Excellent, and a good trial price.

I headed over after doing a bit of stuff around town to kill time after
work, signed up and borrowed a yoga mat. Don't expect me to tell you all
that we did, as I know it will take me forever to remember names, I just
know that today the instructor decided to do a bunch of forward folds in
different ways. About half way through I was mildly sweaty, but not a
lot. And the end was a time of nearly napping relaxation.

I don't feel that I was pushing too hard, and I like that. I figure I
will be nervous about this for a while yet, but I will go back. Now
where did I put that yoga mat I bought a while back?
