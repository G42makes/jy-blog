I am an IT generalist who has been working since 1999 to improve my
skills. I work with servers, networks and pretty well anything that
people throw at me. I'm currently interested in becoming more skilled
with messaging and unified communications, but will dig into anything
interesting when it comes along.

In my free time, aside from playing with my personal network, I like to
do photography, hike, bike, kayak and ski. I'm an active member of the
Canadian Ski Patrol System, and that leads to many hours on the ski hill
over the winter.

I will add more as I come up with it, it turns out that I'm not that
good at describing myself.
