My name is Jared Young. I'm and IT guy in Ottawa, Canada and I live in
the small town of Almonte just outside the city. I like to try and do
things from scratch to see how they are done and this leads me to
dreaming of big projects that might take a lot of time to complete.

I do some photography, but not much lately, and spend a lot of time
outside exploring or just enjoying things, summer or winter.
