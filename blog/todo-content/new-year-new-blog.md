Let's try this again. Not quite the first of the year, but I don't see
any reason to do everything at once. It's a new year, and I think it's
time to start a new blog. I don't know what I will keep here, but
probably details of the random stuff I like to try to do. I have a new
house, with a workshop to setup, so there might be a chance of actually
getting some of these projects off the ground finally.

For example:

-   Making Skis: I have wanted to make my own from scratch for years
-   Kayak Assembly: Hand made wooden kayak
-   Mead: Setup and make some more
-   Gardening: Grow my own food and store it
-   Prepping: Having some level of preparedness if things go
    really wrong.
-   Video and Photo Logging: Document some of the stuff I do, so maybe
    someone else can learn from me.

Let's see where it goes from here.
