Years ago, while chatting with some of the other techs I work with, I
came up with the idea of a USB stick that could have ISO files for CDs
and DVDs loaded on it and allow you to boot from it as if it was an
optical drive. None of us had the skill or knowledge required to even
say if it was doable, but I still wanted one many times in the years
since. As a tech we often have to load software on systems that don't
have optical drives. These systems are becoming more and more common
these days, but many small laptops and low end servers already don't
have that option. I do have a CD/DVD drive that runs entirely on USB,
but it feels to fragile to keep in my IT kit, and I would still have to
carry 20 or 30 discs with me. Now, on
[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/), there is a new project that
looks almost ready to ship this exact product. It's called the
[isostick](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elegantinvention/isostick-the-optical-drive-in-a-usb-stick)and
I am a backer of this project.

I have backed other funded projects on Kickstarter, but not yet received
the finished products in those situations. I do hope this project is
fully funded as this will make my daily job easier and faster(the read
speeds on these are about 10xDVD and almost 100xCD, no physical drives
come near that). If this tests well it may become one of those products
that has to be on every technicians key-chain. Additionally, the drive
can work as a standard USB stick, allowing it to have more functionality
and ensuring that I can retire the current USB stick in favor of this
one.

We shall see, I'll try to remember to update this site if I receive the
stick and post a review.
