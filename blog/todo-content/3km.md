Another mid week run, even colder then previous ones. I was thinking way
too much about my speed and therefore it is all over the
place.<!--more-->

-22 C out there, and the ice buildup on the only part of me exposed, my
eyes, is interesting once I get back inside. Still getting cold skin on
my belly, don't really know how to stop that, but my feet warmed up
faster this time.

New headphones, wireless bluetooth ones that I'll review later, really
worked great on this run, so I think they are keepers. I really need to
setup voice prompts in Endomondo so I know where I am at, right now I
have nothing.

I really hope it starts to warm up soon.
