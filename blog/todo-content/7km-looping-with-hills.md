After wandering a few areas of the town last week, I decided to finally
head across the bay and see about doing some distance there. I
combination of hills and loops was what I got.<!--more-->\[iframe

Unfortunately there was still a lot of snow on the ground and roads from
the last snowfall, and finding bare patches of pavement was difficult.
This caused my right arch to act up quickly in my run. Luckily for me I
was able to manage it and finish the run, but there were a few times
that I was thinking about cutting it short.

I went past the high school and doubled back to the bridges, then across
the bay and into that subdivision. The bay hill and other valleys in the
subdivision kept me busy with a number of different hills, which I think
was a good thing. They helped me adjust my run without changing my
overall pace too much. I think I passed one guy 3 times as he was out
for a walk.

More sore then the last run, but still quite good. I think I need to do
a longer stretch routine after the run, maybe even an adapted yoga
routine.

I found my heart rate monitor, so there is that stat added to the data
above. Unfortunately I think it reads way too high, so I need to find if
I can calibrate it.
