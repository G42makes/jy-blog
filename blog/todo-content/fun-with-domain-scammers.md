I've listed a few of my old, unused, domains for sale on eBay. Just
trying to get rid of them(the one in this post is now sold). I have put
domains up for sale in the past, and received scam emails like the one
I've posted below before(and actually did research to see if they were
legit, I almost believed them). The basic scam is simple: they offer to
buy the domain, but need to have it reviewed for value and trademark
status before they can go ahead, by a reputable source. They, of course,
link you to a service that they have used and recommend you go with
them. The catch is that they either run that service or are partnered
with it and make a profit off of every domain that is evaluated. Then,
when you get back to them with the info they requested, they have some
excuse that the money was spent elsewhere and they can no longer buy
your domain. You were just suckered out of \$100 or so. Since I knew
this scam, I decided to see if I could mess with them back. The
following exchange occurred and is unedited, so I probably typo'd a
bunch of stuff. Pretty well everything I say is a lie, so don't worry
about that side of things, I knew it was a scammer from the start. I'm
impressed it went this far. (Sorry about formatting issues, some o fit
just didn't transfer well.)

| If you want to list it for \$5000, that is no problem for me. No website |
| included, just the domain. I'm located in Canada, but the business with  |
| legal ownership is registered and operates in most countries. Escrow     |
| will be fine with me. I don't use any of the domain seller forums, this  |
| domain was purchased for a project that was never completed or released  |
| publicly and we are selling it as an asset for our needs.                |

| Yeah, I totally understand that one. I don't think our lawyers would     |

| Luckily, as we wanted to create a global brand, the lawyers were useful. |
| The trademark was registered in the US, EU and my understanding is that  |
| it is registered in about 100 countries. I'll happily forward you the    |
| details once the money hits the escrow account. If you are satisfied     |

| Sure no problem. Since this is going to cost us upfront(for a service    |
| that I have already paid for with another provider, who is generally the |
| trusted source) you will understand that we will require verification of |
| a deposit with [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/) for the purchase of the  |
| domain, plus the value of the appraisal(\$110USD). Once we have that     |
| information I'll request the appraisal from your preferred source and we |
| can proceed with the transaction. If there is a problem with the         |
| process, there is no risk for you as you get your money back.            |
| Unfortunately, the finance guys will not approve purchasing an           |
| additional appraisal after approving one just the other month for the    |
| same domain unless I can show that it is already paid for.               |

| Oh, we have no problem with providing that information, as I have        |
| stated, what's bothering us is that is has to come from that one         |
| provider. Why would your buyer trust a company's valuation where I could |
| literally "<span style="font-family: Arial;"><span                       |
| style="font-family: Arial;">write in the comment field that you have a   |
| buyer with \$X,XXX offer so you need the appraisal near this value".     |
| That makes the valuation worthless. If you still want the valuation,     |
| fine, at the \$5000 price point all you have to do is place the money in |
| escrow with [escrow.com](http://escrow.com/) and I will order the        |
| valuation immediatly upon confirmation that the money is there. If I     |
| don't provide that data for you, then you don't have to buy the domain,  |
| but once I provide the valuation from them I will consider my end of the |
| deal completed and will expect to close the deal within the week with    |
| the transfer of the domain to you. Please note, that as I explained      |
| earlier, we own the trademarks on these domains in multiple countries    |
| and therefore expect any competent trademark search should show exactly  |
| each country that it is registered in(80+ according to the guys in       |
| legal, they didn't want to waste time counting exactly, but promised me  |
| it was standard when they registered a trademark to go well above that   |
| mark). When we see the report I expect you will be able to tell how well |
| your provider really do their research and find out if they should       |
| really be the source you trust.</span></span>Jared                       |
