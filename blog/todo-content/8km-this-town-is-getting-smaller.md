Went for a run last Monday, but forgot to log it. The goal was 8KM, but
based on my previous run, I was no expecting to finish the full
distance. I pushed myself past some of the pain and was able to get my
8KM in, but I also did almost a full lap around the town.

The first 4KM were pretty good, and I was way across town by the time
soreness kicked in. I pushed through it, but doing so messed up my
stride. An imperfect stride is still quite doable, so I kept on. Nothing
too bad beyond that.

The route was designed to go on the furthest outer roads that I could
easily take for each section of town I was running in. I was not doing
dead ends today. I did run on the highway for a bit, but turned off that
as soon as I could. It was not really dangerous, just more stress then I
wanted.

Recovery was another thing. Writing this from a week later, I can easily
say that my legs are still sore and I did not run yesterday in order to
give myself some more recovery time. I don't like to run on minor
injuries, I know plenty of people do, but I feel that I don't want to
break things too much.

Right now I think I could finish a 1/2 Marathon if I were to run one
today. The time would not be great, but I would finish it. From here the
goal is to increase my chances of feeling good at the end of that
distance.
